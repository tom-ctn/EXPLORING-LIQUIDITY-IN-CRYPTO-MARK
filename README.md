# EXPLORING-LIQUIDITY-IN-CRYPTO-MARK
This project explores liquidity and price formation in cryptocurrency markets through modern market microstructure analysis. Using high-frequency Binance trade data, it computes the price response function 
𝑅(𝑉,𝜏),it studies impact concavity via the regression  R(V,τ)≈A(τ)ln(V)+B(τ), and measures trade sign autocorrelation to detect order-flow persistence and metaorders. The framework provides clear visualizations of impact vs. trade size, impact decay through time, volume–impact slopes, and order-flow memory. Results show strong contrasts across assets: BTC displays highly efficient, low-impact behavior, while mid- and small-cap tokens exhibit transient price impact, stronger concavity, and significant mean reversion. The project offers a practical toolkit for understanding liquidity, adverse selection, and market-making incentives in crypto markets.
